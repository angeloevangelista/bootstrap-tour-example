        <p>
          Some paragraph very well styled and so much useful to understand this
          app in a simply way.

            <p>
              Here we have some kind of text letting You see a preview of our
              app.
            </p>

            <p>
              Just as expected, this is a pretty container full of "lero lero"
              which some kind of developers usually calls "Lorem ipsum", but
              sometime it's neither so beautiful to read nor to exercise my
              english writing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Yeah! I am really training my english with this page. Some people
              would say I don't have that thing, uh.. I maybe have forgotten the
              name as the time went by. Yay! It's <i>focus</i>. But I really
              fell happy to know You are still reading thing, make sure I
              laughed a little while thinking about how unfocused You are to be
              still reading this at this time. But thank You for that
              <span id="heart">ðŸ’œ</span>.
